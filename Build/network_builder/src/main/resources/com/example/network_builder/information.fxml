Initially, it provided a highly effective method of routing calls on mechanical telephone systems. While it was overtaken by further advancements in switching. technology in the years following its formalisation, it later became the basis of switch operations in Ethernet data communications in the 1990s in data center networks, and serves as the basis of many large-scale, interconnected fabrics to this day. For this reason, Clos Networks are vital for many cloud-based operations today." wrappingWidth="658.27734375" GridPane.rowIndex="2" />

Having a lot of the same use cases as a Clos Network, the Slepian Network is a rearrangable non-blocking network, used in telecommunication networks, but also in multi-processor systems and parallel computers, given its innate non-blocking characteristics and rearranging opportunities. For this reason, while similar, the Clos and Slepian Networks have very different use cases.&#10;A Slepian network architecture may be chosen over a Clos network due to its known ability to efficiently route permutations, meaning blocked call pathways are made through rerouting existing calls through different pathways. This is done at each stage through the switches contained withinthem. For applicaitons where dynamic rearrangement is required, this provides a clear solutionthat a Clos network does not." wrappingWidth="655.49609375" GridPane.rowIndex="4" />

Then, enter all relevant information into the areas provided and wait as the application generates your network, where you can view information including how the numbers were calculated, the number of stages (if not specified), and more.&#10;NOTE: this application is experimental, and as such there may be cases where application may perform below expectations.
